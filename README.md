# Covid-19 Dashboard

The project is a dashboard that views COVID-19 statistics. First, you have to select a state to view the current and historical statistics for that state.
> The app needs some need more improvements and optimizations but there is not enough time.

## Historical Chart

This chart presents positive cases of one or more states over time. 
> There may be some issue in the date range, I didn't have enough time to fix this bug.
> 
## Latest statistics

First, you should select at least one state. If you select one state the app will view the current trends in the cards as we consider this to be your state, but if you select more than one state the state comparison mode will be activated and show a chart that compares between states based on the latest statistics. 

## Filter

The dashboard also provides a Filter which gives you the states with specific rules.

## Setup instructions
The App uses Vite as a build tool and Yarn as a package manager: 

- run `yarn` or `npm install` to install the dependencies 
-  run `yarn dev`  or `npm run dev` to start a dev server
